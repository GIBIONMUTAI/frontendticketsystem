# project summary
# A brief explanation of the database schema
I used SQLite database schema for managing tickets. The tickets table stores ticket information, including a unique id, title, description, priority (defaulting to "Low"), status (defaulting to "Open"), and createdAt timestamp. The id is an auto-incrementing primary key. The title is a required text field, while description, priority, and status are optional. The createdAt field automatically records the ticket creation time. This schema efficiently organizes ticket data for retrieval, updates, and deletion.
### A demo of the system in action
This Project of ticket management system is using Node.js and SQLite DB for backend and React.JS for frontend. It creates, reads, updates, and deletes tickets stored in the SQLite database. When a user creates a new ticket via the Frontend(UI), the backend stores the title, description, priority, and status. Similarly, when a user views, edits, or deletes a ticket through the UI, the backend interacts with the database to fetch, modify, or remove the corresponding data as per users wish. The UI then displays the updated information enabling the user to access whatâ€™s in the database from the frontend side.
